-Workshop time will be replaced with project time
-Pick an idea that would take about 3 weeks to complete
-You should've developed an idea over the workshops based on which workshop material you liked best
-Look at Ideas text file to get some ideas
-You can also start working on a Rapid project during this time
-Some Rapid members (mainly me) will be there to answer questions about your project
-You can use any non-perishable tool Rapid has, and you'll get 150g of plastic to print your project
-Anything else, you have to buy it yourself
-At the end, you'll join a Rapid project led by some senior member
-I'll ask you about what you've learn at the end of your project

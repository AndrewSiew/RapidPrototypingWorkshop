# RapidPrototypingWorkshop
### Overview
This series covers 3D printer components and maintenance, as well as CAD and other rapid prototyping tools. New UBC Rapid members has to go through a semester long, once a week workshop series about basics of rapid prototyping. The end of this workshop series is designed to give new members a chance to work on their own project, so they can have real experience on what they've learned and choose and explore some specific topics in greater depth.

Although this workshop series is made for UBC Rapid, it can be used for anyone who wants to learn rapid prototyping/3D printing. Feel free to use it for personal use, but please contact me at rprakitpong@gmail.com for non-personal use(s).

### How this will work
- Use Slack to ask questions during the week. Ask questions if you feel like you're falling behind.
- After a workshop ends, check slides of upcoming workshop and do the pre-workshops beforehand. We'll make edits throughout the term, but we'll make sure a workshop is done-done a week before so you have time to do pre-workshops.

### Changes to next year's workshops
- assign more things to pre workshop, so can reduce ws time 1hr30min -> 45min

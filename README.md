# RapidPrototypingWorkshop
### Overview
This series covers 3D printer components and maintenance, as well as CAD and other rapid prototyping tools. New UBC Rapid members has to go through a semester long, once a week workshop series about basics of rapid prototyping. The end of this workshop series is designed to give new members a chance to work on their own project, so they can have real experience on what they've learned and choose and explore some specific topics in greater depth.

Although this workshop series is made for UBC Rapid, it can be used for anyone who wants to learn rapid prototyping/3D printing. Feel free to use it for personal use, but please contact me at rprakitpong@gmail.com for non-personal use(s).

### How this will work
- Use Slack to ask questions during the week. Ask questions if you feel like you're falling behind.
- After a workshop ends, check slides of upcoming workshop and do the pre-workshops beforehand. We'll make edits throughout the term, but we'll make sure a workshop is done-done a week before so you have time to do pre-workshops.
- We'll use Google Meet to meet weekly for workshops. Meeting time is 7-8pm Friday. It'll be about an hour or so.
- After the workshop, we'll give you a simple quiz with a Google Form. 
- You'll do a simple project over NY break and we'll place you into subteams based on your interests and team availabilities. We're still deciding on how you'll present your projects.

### Changes to next year's workshops
- assign more things to pre workshop, so can reduce ws time 1hr30min -> 45min

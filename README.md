# RapidPrototypingWorkshop
### Overview
New UBC Rapid members has to go through a semester long, once a week workshop series about basics of rapid prototyping. This series covers 3D printer components and maintenance, as well as CAD and other design tools. The end of this workshop series is designed to give new members a chance to work on their own project, so they can have real experience on what they've learned and choose and explore some specific topics in greater depth.

# RapidPrototypingWorkshop
### Overview
This series covers 3D printer components and maintenance, as well as CAD and other design tools. New UBC Rapid members has to go through a semester long, once a week workshop series about basics of rapid prototyping. The end of this workshop series is designed to give new members a chance to work on their own project, so they can have real experience on what they've learned and choose and explore some specific topics in greater depth.

Although this workshop series is made for UBC Rapid, it can be used for anyone who wants to learn rapid prototyping/3D printing. Feel free to use it for personal use, but please contact me at rprakitpong@gmail.com for non-personal use(s).
